# AndroidSqlite
Problem
In this project you are asked to implement a simple mobile application that manages student registrations with using SQLite database. Actually this project is
improvement of the second assignment with SQLite database.
• The first tab, administration tab, used to input data such as, faculties,
departments, and lecturer etc. So, this tab is used to get general information
of a university. Because of this reason, this tab should have buttons such as,
“add”,”delete”,“update” and ”search“, ”display” etc. These data should be
save a database.
• The second tab, it is a registration tab, used to register a student. To do this,
students should have a Student ID (10 digit, generate it randomly), gender
(male or female, use radio buttons), name, last name, Faculty, Department,
Advisor (for the last three fields, users only select defined names from the
administration tab, access the database). To finish the registration task, add
some buttons such as, ”register”, ”cancel“, ”update”, and ”search“ in order
to make general solutions. To complete the registration, you should have
confirmation process (see dialog boxes).
• The third tab, registered students tab, displays all student that have been
registered so far. When ever a student name is clicked on the list, all information of the student should be displayed within a pop up frame (window, or in
a message dialog box, see lecture slides).
• Note: Design your app for general purpose. It means you should consider exceptions, scroll list, display rows with different colors, give relative notification
or messages to users and design a friendly user interface.
• Add Menu item (context or option) that gives short description about your
app.
• In your database you should have tables for administration and students.
When ever a student make registration, related administration data should be
read from the administration table
